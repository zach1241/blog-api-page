      "Full stack development refers to the ability to work on both the frontend and backend of web applications. A full stack developer is capable of building user interfaces with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also managing databases, servers, and APIs. Learning both sides of development provides flexibility and opens the door to creating complete, end-to-end solutions.",

    content:
      "Frontend development focuses on the visual parts of a website or app â€” the buttons, forms, and layouts that users interact with. Backend development powers the behind-the-scenes logic, such as APIs, databases, and authentication systems. A full stack developer bridges both areas, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend layers of a project.",

For the backend, Node.js, Express, and Django are widely used. Databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL handle data storage, while tools like Git and Docker help manage code and deployments efficiently.",
